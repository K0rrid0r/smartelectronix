Hi there!


so here are H2O's sources...
obviously for your eyes only ;)

version.txt should be included in the package.

resource.h has some bmp<->#define numbers, but I don't know if this is sufficient.



cheers + LOT'S of thanx!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


filenames should be:

H2O_v1.0_MAC.sit
H2O_v1.0_BeOS.zip


Bram

PS: feel free to correct any mistakes in the version.txt ;)
