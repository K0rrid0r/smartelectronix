# Bram @ Smartelectronix
Open source versions of all bram @ smartelectronix plugins. 20 Years after woking on my first plugin I've decided to open source all these plugins. Consider a lot of this source code was written by a very inexperienced version of myself: it's kind of a mess!

You can find the original smartelectronix pages here: http://bram.smartelectronix.com

All UIs were created with VstGUI around version 2.x, same for the plugins, they use VST 2.x.
You will need the VST SDK an VST GUI SDK: http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html
